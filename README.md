# FlappyBirdUnity
A basic build of Flappy Bird in Unity for learning purposes

I wrote this while I was learning the basics of Unity so it's not likely the most well written version of this out there - feel free to take it and use it for whatever purposes you need it for regardless!

I hope it helps you out and God bless.
